Stripe Inc.

Patrick and John Collison

***How did the idea for the company come about:*** 
Patrick had already founded and sold a company called Auctomatic which offered auction and marketplace management for sellers on sites such as Ebay and Amazon as well as working on many side projects.

***Who is the company’s intended customer:*** Stripe’s customers are anybody or any company that needs to process payments online. Their largest customers are Google, Amazon, Shopify, Zoom, Slack, Lyft, etc. Digital payments are estimated to be $4.88T for 2021.

***What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not:*** Prior to Stripe’s existence, smaller merchants would have to enter direct agreements also known as merchant acquirers with Visa and MasterCard to accept payments. This was a long process that would take these companies months of complex paperwork, administrative challenges and also created barriers for small businesses to work with. Stripes’ solution solved all of these problems for credit card companies by making it simpler for smaller merchants to integrate Stripe while assisting Visa and Mastercard in achieving their strategic objectives. Stripe allowed these companies to integrate their automated software within minutes rather than months. With the implementation of their payment processing platform, stripe allows global businesses to accept, store, manage, and pay out money globally within a single integration. Stripe maximizes revenue for businesses by improving authorization rates on every payment while reducing declines with powerful machine learning.Stripe developed capabilities which enabled them to embed everything a platform needed in a software as a Service API through their “stripe connect” development. Which is what makes them so unique compared to competitors.

***Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them:*** Stripe developed capabilities which enabled them to embed everything a platform needed in a software as a Service API through their “stripe connect” development. However, major tech stacks used by Stripe include Ruby and JavaScript. Ruby mainly powers the back end of stripe such as stripe.com, stripe API, dashboard, and more. For Application and Data technology used by Stripe includes Ruby (G5), NSQ, Apache Impala.For utilities, they use Google Analytics, Amazon Route 53, Amazon SES, Mailgun, Mixpanel, Mandrill, and Framer. DevOps technology includes CircleCI, Pager Duty.

***What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years:*** In the financial services domain, it is evident that we are living in an age of digital evolution. Where digital advancement and increased financial technology is transforming the financial sector at a fast rate. Two trends include tapping into the huge gig worker opportunity and the growing influence of big tech companies.

Focusing on attracting developers was a key trend and strategy to be able to thrive in this domain. Along with recognition of industry shifts where large banks were focused on developing complex solutions for major retailers. Therefore, simplifying this process and providing a faster solution for all was the best innovation and idea which differentiates one from the rest. This is what retailers, smaller businesses, and merchants were searching for the entire time.

### Recommendations 

I would recommend Stripe to offer a credit card, and expand their business to consumer and business payments anywhere a credit card is accepted. Offering this will increase revenue for the company as the credit card business is very lucrative. It makes a lot of money in interest rates and fees. Stripe's abundance of security measures would be heavily utilized.
